            I have been a software engineer in the video games industry for almost 20 years, spanning four generations of consoles and several shipped titles. The majority of my time in the industry has been spent working in the audio domain, though I also have some experience in rendering, engine systems, and gameplay.

          I am passionate about the art of video game sound! I enjoy working with audio artists, content professionals, and fellow programmers to help provide a voice to the game, as well as building and streamlining tools and workflows so artists can spend more of their time doing what they do best - making the best game audio possible!
