This was taken, with permission, from the example provided by Chuck Groom found here: https://cgroom.medium.com/a-software-engineers-one-page-portfolio-4f85ab8a20d1#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20a%20senior,that%27s%20easy%20to%20pass%20along..

This is based on a heavily pared-down version Jerome Lachaud's [Freelancer Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme).
Jerome's original theme is well-suited for designers to easily assemble a portfolio site of their visual work; this
is a prose-centric version tailored to software developers. [formspree](http://formspree.io/) is used for the contact form.
